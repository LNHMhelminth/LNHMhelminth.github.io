### codeFests!

Every month starting in Spring 2026, we will be putting on coding events open to all interested folks. These will challenge folks with fun problems related to helminth parasites, though often we will keep only a tenuous connection with worm parasites. 



#### Some scheduled activities

+ Programmatically analyzing Spotify data on worm related songs and artists
+ Brain teaser helminth coding problems (e.g., solve a helminth word search programmatically)
+ Spatial plotting and analysis of helminth parasites 
+ Predicting helminth parasites most likely to infect humans (that currently do not)
+ Helminth game development (`Subway Surfers` ... but with worms)
