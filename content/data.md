The data are available as a version controlled data package in R called `helminthR`. This allows for releases of the dynamic data product, with the most current release [available here](https://github.com/ropensci/helminthR/releases/tag/v1.1.0). Always use the most updated semantic version (should correspond to most recent release) for the most up-to-date data, and always reference which version was used for your particular analyses in peer-reviewed publications. 


When using the data, please cite the original curators:

In the database, there are currently over 220,000 rows of data consisting of a
total of over 120,000 unique interactions between host species and helminth
parasites. There are also over 20,000 unique host species and over 29,000 unique
helminth parasite species.
